# Working with TypeScript Code Along

## Learning Goals

- Successfully setting up local environment to run TypeScript
- Understanding the ts.config file
- Compiling with `tsc`

## Introduction

TypeScript is a very useful and powerful tool we can use to optimize our code by
checking for syntax errors before runtime, giving tips on how to fix bugs before
they happen and more, all by adding in types to our regular JavaScript code!
Though we can start using TypeScript right out of the box, it does recognize
that every application and developer is different, and gives us some room for
flexibility. We get access to this flexibility/customization through the
ts.config file that we will keep in the root of our application, where we can
change default rules, and add some rules of our own!

## Environment Setup

- fork and clone this lab, then open in your text editor
- install ts globally

You should already have Node Installed on your machine, but if you haven't,
please do so following the [Node.js Installation Docs][]. If you would like a
more detailed walk through, please use the following repositories:

- [Installing NVM & Node.js on MacOS][]
- [Installing NVM & Node.js on WSL2][]



## The ts.config file

- what does this file do
- checkout the provided tsc file
- run tsc to see the errors

## Compiling with `tsc`

- then fix the errors
- then run tsc to see there are no more errors
- run node index.js to run our code
- submit code

## Conclusion

- we did all these things
